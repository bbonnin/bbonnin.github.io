401	Unauthorized			Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication. 401 semantically means "unauthenticated", i.e. "you don't have necessary credentials". Note: Some sites issue HTTP 401 when an IP is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific IP address doesn't own the permissions to access a website.
